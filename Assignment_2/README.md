- Learn how to use vim for yourself
- Install a vim plug-in[Thesaurus Query](https://github.com/Ron89/thesaurus_query.vim) Query by senior follow apprentice HeChong and star him.
- Do exercise referring to [**How to think like a computer scientist -- Learning with Python: Interactive Edition 2.0**](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/thinkcspy/index.html) 

## Abstract
   This homework mainly talks about some basic operations with vim for those new to python under Linux system. In this document, I have listed fundamental knowledge about vim to get one quickly into using vim.
   
## Introduction
  For physics major students, computational physics has become a very important branch, especially when we have to deal with vast data. In various computing softwares, we turn to python, which is quite popular among modern physics field. In this document, I would present a general concept of the major editor we use -- vim. Then, I would show some basic tricks for writing a python program. 

## Body 
  In order to learn to use something new, we must know what it is and what it can do first. To put it in simple terms, vim is a kind of a editor, which you can use to write original program, just like writing simple text document. But this time, the readers are compilers and computers, so you have to use particular 'language' to make sure that the computer can understand what you want 'him' to do for you. Besides, you have to know that different 'languages' have its own unique 'grammars' and 'word'. Usually, they differ from each other, which is also quite common in real life: people from different places speak something with different languages. Consequently, you have to figure out what kind of machine your program are running on. In this part I would just introduce some common operations in conducting a vim editor. 
  Here, I would give a brief description of how the software works. So at least, you have to download one from the Internet and install in proper place.Â
