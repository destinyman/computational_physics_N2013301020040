# simulation of population growth model

## ***Abstract***
 In this part, I have wrote a program to simulate the initial value problem of the population growth model and curved  the result with the help of Matplotlib. The main method I have used is the Euler method. From the curve, we can see that with different initial values of the model: mainly the initial population, the parameter ' **a** ' and " **b** ", the shapes of the curves differ much from each other.
