# simulation of population growth model

## ***Abstract***
 In this part, I have wrote a program to simulate the initial value problem of the population growth model and curved  the result with the help of Matplotlib. The main method I have used is the Euler method. From the curve, we can see that with different initial values of the model: mainly the initial population, the parameter ' **a** ' and " **b** ", the shapes of the curves differ much from each other.

## ***Background Introduction***
The population growth model was first presented by [Thomas Robert Malthus](http://www.baidu.com/link?url=vVos2-we_tXKQp6m6Z90Lwsym8wepCHdk_a1BnGMLmZliAX5MyIySH4zxRvQa5edAcnpIJSN8DZou6WWVGgNCK&wd=&eqid=f93bf0730008e74a0000000556f94365) , who is an English cleric and scholar, influential in the fields of political economy and demography. Inspired by ancient concepts about mankind, he thought that the dangers of population growth precluded progress towards an Utopian society: *"The power of population is indefinitely greater than the power in the earth to produce subsistence for man."* and later gave out his own theory of the population growth model. By which, he meant that *the increase of population is necessarily limited by the means of subsistence, that population does invariably increase when the means of subsistence increase, and, that the superior power of population is repressed, and the actual population kept equal to the means of subsistence, by misery and vice.
