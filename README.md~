 ***T***his repository is specially created for the learning of computational physics. mainly, the programs in this seciton are after-class assignments, while some maybe original creations just for fun. I wil continue to update the latest progress untill the end of the lesson.
 
## Introdcution to the lesson
  #The computational physics lesson is dedicated for college students in department of physics.
 　With the deep development of computatioal methods and the popularization of high speed computer，physicists are glad to find that with the
 help of this convinient tool, they are able to dedign much more complex and comprehensive model to quantitively research the complicated 
system under actual conditions, on the basis of fundamental physics theories. Numerical computation and simulation based on fundamental
 physical principles have become an importrant bridge to connect theoritical physics and experimental physics, owing to its natural 
strengthes in fast and accurate calculation and low cost in simulation, expecically in the field of condended matter nuclear physcis etx., 
which requires superb technologies and expensive systems. Therefore, grasping necessary computational physics knowledge and methods has 
become more and more essential for the development for a successful phusicist.
