# The distance between "hearts"
____
Well, starting the direction with a poem to demonstrate what I'am going to talk about seems to be a good idea.


Strange, to  wander  in  the  fog                                                   
　　　each  bush  and  stone  stands  alone<br>
No  tree  sees  the  next  one  
　　　each  is  alone 
       
My  world  is   full  of  friends  
　　　when  my  life  is  filled  with  light<br>
Now  as  the  fog  decends<br>
　　　none  is  still  to  be  seen

Truly  there  is  no  wise  man<br>
　　　who  does  not  know  the  dark<br>
Which  is  quietly  and  inescapably<br>
　　　seperates  him  from  anyone  else
 
Strange,  to  wander  in  the  fog  
　　　to  live  is  to  be  alone<br> 
No  man  knows  the  next  man<br>
　　　each  is  alone<br>   
　　　　　　　　　　　　　---By Hesse<br>
