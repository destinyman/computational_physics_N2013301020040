# The distance between "hearts"
____
Well, starting the direction with a poem to illustrate what I'am going to talk about seems to be a good idea.


***Strange, to  wander  in  the  fog***                                                   
　　　***each  bush  and  stone  stands  alone<br>***
***No  tree  sees  the  next  one***  
　　　***each  is  alone*** 
       
***My  world  is   full  of  friends***  
　　　***when  my  life  is  filled  with  light<br>***
***Now  as  the  fog  decends<br>***
　　　***none  is  still  to  be  seen***

***Truly  there  is  no  wise  man<br>***
　　　***who  does  not  know  the  dark<br>***
***Which  is  quietly  and  inescapably<br>***
　　　***seperates  him  from  anyone  else***
 
***Strange,  to  wander  in  the  fog<br>*** 
　　　***to  live  is  to  be  alone<br>*** 
***No  man  knows  the  next  man<br>***
　　　***each  is  alone<br>***   　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　---By Hesse<br>
　　In this poem, the poest confessed his own thought over the existence state of human beings. He thought as long as we existence in this world, we were all alone. Even if we lived in the same society, breathe the same air, walked on the same land, talked about the same weather, and spoke the same language, we were all alone in the depth of our hearts. The distance between hearts is far byond the reach of any superfacial contacts.
